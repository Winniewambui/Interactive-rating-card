# Interactive-rating-card
This is an interactive rating card that allows users to rate a support request. The rating is from 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest rating and 5 being the highest. This project was created as part of a challenge by Frontend Mentor.
This project uses the following;
Font Awesome 6.3.0
Google Fonts (Overpass)
To use the rating card, simply open the HTML file in your web browser.
You can rate the support request by clicking on one of the buttons with numbers 1 to 5.
Once you have selected a rating, click on the "Submit" button to submit your rating.
After submitting your rating, a "Thank you" message will appear, showing you the rating you selected and thanking you for taking the time to provide feedback.
Feel free to use this project for your own purposes or to learn from it. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me at @Winnie__Beth.
